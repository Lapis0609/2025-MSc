Single-cell sequencing enables the analysis of gene expression at the individual cell level, leading to unique data management requirements due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the data. Single-cell sequencing encompasses a diverse array of techniques to sequence transcriptomics, epigenomics and combinations of multiple modalities (multiomics) at single-cell resolution, each presenting its own set of challenges and considerations. Additionally, the field embraces a wide range of data analysis approaches, further compounding the complexity. Consequently, addressing the standardised description and storage of data and associated metadata becomes paramount in this context. To ensure the reproducibility and reliability of research findings, it is crucial to proactively identify the specific steps in the data workflow that should be preserved.",

This should be done for all types of research data, but is even more important for human data. Information security is usually described as containing three main aspects - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Accessibility. Confidentiality is about measures to ensure that data is kept confidential from those that do not have rights to access the data. Integrity is about measures to ensure that data is not corrupted or destroyed. Accessibility is about measures to ensure that data can be accessed by those that have a right to access it, when they need to access it. Information security measures are both procedural and technical. What information security measures that need to be established should be defined at the planning stage (see above), when doing a risk assessment, e.g. the GDPR Data Protection Impact Assessment. This should identify information security risks, and define measures to mitigate those risks.",

Sharing and reusing of human data\nDescription\nTo make human data reusable for others, it must be discoverable, stored in a safe way, and it must be clear under what circumstances it can be reused. Considerations\n\nSelecting suitable access modes for sharing human data:\n\nHuman data often carries restrictions to its use and it would need to be shared in a manner that obeys such restrictions. There are three access modes for sharing research data:\n\nOpen access: Data is shared publicly. Open-access is a rarely used access mode for the sharing of human data. To use open-access researchers need to ensure that the shared data cannot be traced back to individual study participants. In other words the data needs to be anonymised, which is difficult in practice. Registered access: Data is shared with researchers, whose “researcher” status has been vouched for by their institution and who agree to abide by data usage policies of repositories that serve the shared data.",

Rare disease research is often scarce and scattered among many institutions in different countries – due to the, per definition, low prevalence of RDs. This makes rare diseases a prime example of a research area that can strongly profit from coordination on an international scale, including data management. RD research should be improved to overcome fragmentation, leading to efficacious use of data and resources, faster scientific progress and competitiveness, and most importantly to decrease unnecessary hardship and prolonged suffering of RD patients. Considering the introduction of omics into care practice and the structuration of RD care centers in {% tool \"european-reference-networks\" %}, data management is key to ensure data reuse and interpretation.

Second, specifying who is allowed access to which data using an Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI). The informed consent form should use existing standards for informed consent. The EJP RD has developed a {% tool \"ern-registries-generic-informed-consent-forms\" %}.

In proteomics, the relatively wide range of mass spectrometry technologies, devices, protocols, study designs and data analysis approaches poses a particular challenge for the standardized description and storage of data and associated metadata. This circumstance forced the proteomics community to deal with the complex definition of suitable standard data formats relatively early in its history. This encouraged, among other things, the development of software tools that can import and export results in standardized formats, and of data repositories in which proteomics data can be stored in a standardized way. The particular challenge for the proteomics community now is to evolve its achievements in data management to date towards a more complete fulfillment of FAIR research data management and to close the remaining gaps in this regard.",

Simulation methods are demonstrating rapidly growing impact in areas as diverse as biocatalysis, drug delivery, biomaterials, biotechnology, and drug or protein design. Simulations offer the potential of uniquely detailed, atomic‐level insight into mechanisms, dynamics, and processes, as well as increasingly accurate predictions of molecular properties. Yet the field only relatively recently started to store and share (bio)simulation data to be reused for new, unexpected projects, and started discussions about their biomolecular simulation data FAIRification (i.e. to make them Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).",

Here we show several current possibilities moving in this direction, but we should stress that these guidelines are not carved to stone and the biomolecular simulation community still needs to address challenges to FAIRify their data. Storing and sharing the data from biomolecular simulations\nDescription\nThe biomolecular simulation data comes in several forms and multiple formats, which unfortunately are not completely interoperable. Different methods also require slightly different metadata description. Considerations\n\nWhat type of data do you have? Molecular dynamics data - by far the most typical and largest biomolecular simulation data. Each molecular dynamics simulation is driven by the used engine, force-field, and multiple other and often hidden simulation parameters to produce trajectories that are further analysed. Molecular docking data - docking provides the structures of the complex (e.g. ligand-protein, protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid, etc.) and its score\/energy.",

At the same time, storing images on personal computers or USB keys is no longer an option, assuming it ever was! Data volume is exponentially increasing, and not just the acquired images need storing but potentially processed images will be generated and will need to be kept alongside the original images. It is critical to proactively identify where the data will be stored, for how long, who will cover the cost of the hardware, and who will cover the cost of managing the infrastructure. All the stakeholders need to be involved in the preliminary discussions: biologists, facility managers, data analysis, IT support, etc., to ensure that the requirements are understood and met.",

The image will contain the binary representing the pixels on screen but it is usually packed with useful metadata. You will find the obvious keys indicating how to interpret the zeros and ones, you can also find a lot of acquisition metadata e.g. hardware\/instrument used, settings used, etc. The number of image proprietary formats is very large and keeps increasing. It is challenging to support so many proprietary file formats i.e. read\/extract metadata. The {% tool \"bio-formats\" %} library currently supports over 150 different file formats. The Dataset Structure Table shows the extension of the files to read and indicates the structure of the image itself e.g. single file, multiple files, one image file and a companion file, etc.\nData management challenges\nThe number of files and their size could be extremely large.",

Deleting\/misplacing a file could invalidate the study itself, preventing its reuse. Managing images immediately becomes a larger problem, not only the binary files need to be handled, but also the associated metadata. Several efforts have been made and still ongoing to capture those metadata. Understanding and capturing the metadata are critical for many reasons, just to mention a few: analysis, detection of possible faults in acquisition systems. It is important to decide how much details will be recorded since this could dramatically increase the metadata volume and therefore the effort required to capture the metadata. The collection of images could be: \n - data acquired within a facility;\n - data acquired in other facility (commissioned work or external guest user) and \"transported\" by the users to their facility;\n - slides scanned. After acquisition, data are usually moved to more permanent storages with different level of permissions.",

Instead, the images described above are most frequently collected in proprietary file formats (PFFs) defined by hardware vendors.

Considerations\n\nWhen purchasing a microscope, consider carefully how the resulting files will be processed. If open source tools will be used, proprietary file formats may require a time-consuming conversion. Discuss with your vendor if an open format is available. If data from multiple vendors is to be combined, similar a conversion may be necessary to make the data comparable. Imaging data brings special considerations due to the large, often continuous nature of the data. Single terabyte-scale files are not uncommon. Sharing these can require special infrastructure, like a data management server (described below) or a cloud-native format (described below). One goal of such infrastructure is to enable the selective (i.e. interactive) zooming of your image data without the need to download the entire volume, thereby reducing your internet bandwidth and costs.

These chemicals range from substances found in nature to those made in the laboratory for many purposes (drugs, agrochemicals, pesticides, dyes, food additives, cosmetics, household products, etc.). A part of the toxicological research is devoted to the study of the adverse effects generated by chemicals in humans, while another part is devoted to the study of the noxious effects of the chemicals in the environment. The adversity is observed for a compound at a certain concentration. Consequently, hazard characterization should always consider exposure data. Toxicology was traditionally an observational science that obtained an important part of its data by means of experiments carried out on animals.",

However, the limitations of animal models to produce human-relevant data, as well as the implementation of the 3R policies (reduction, replacement, and refinement of the animal experimentation) have motivated a change of paradigm towards a more mechanistic view. Many international initiatives are promoting this change. In this page, the relevant toxicological data management issues from in vitro, animal and human assays and ecotoxicology studies are explained, as well as the appropriate solutions for them. It has to be pointed out that most of the toxicology data is generated in a regulatory context, following guidelines for obtaining marketing approval and it constitutes an extremely valuable resource that should be made available to the scientific community. For that reason, efforts are being made for the systematic collection and storage of this data, as well as its standardization, which enables its integration and joint analysis.",

Data from in vitro assays - Data analysis and modelling\nDescription\nIn vitro cell culture technologies are commonly used in toxicology. They provide an alternative to animal testing and allow to assess the response of the cells to toxicant exposure. They also provide unique access to biochemical, and morphological changes that can not be observed in vivo. The most commonly used systems are immortalized cell lines and primary cell cultures. Although two-dimensional cell cultures are very popular, it has been shown that they do not represent the in vivo situation, as they are still far from the tissue organization and the cellular connections seen in an organism. Recent advances in three-dimensional cell culture technologies have allowed the widespread use of organoids. Organoids have been used for in vitro modelling of drug adverse effects, specifically in organs commonly susceptible to drug-induced toxicities (i.e. gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney).",

Among the diverse sources of toxicological in vitro data it is worth mentioning the results of the Toxicology in the 21st Century program, or {% tool \"tox21-toolbox\" %}. The results of this project (data and tools) are publicly available. Gene expression changes that occur in biological systems in response to exposure to xenobiotics may represent mechanistically relevant cellular events contributing to the onset and progression of xenobiotic-induced adverse health outcomes.

They include exhaustive medical information on a single patient or a set of patients with similar symptomatology which is gathered from health care facilities to identify etiology.\n- Epidemiologic studies (ESs) are focused on the possible association between the exposure to a substance and the potential adverse reactions observed in a given human population. ESs are classified as occupational (individuals are exposed in the workplace), or environmental (individuals are exposed through daily living). In the pharmaceutical context though, intentional human exposure to drug candidates is a necessary step in the development of medications. During the clinical trial stage, human exposure to substances is required to characterize efficacy and safety. This process consists of several phases which are exhaustively controlled and subjected to strict regulations and ethical review.",

Each stage of the patient journey has different associated data types,  a number of  technical, ethical, legal and organisational challenges.

Survival rate improvement in most major tumour types depends on early detection, which has prompted screening programs in many European countries. These programs produce highly relevant data sets for further (data-driven) research on early cancer diagnostics. This data typically consists of health and bioimaging data, such as mammograms, colonoscopies, or blood tests. Most of this data contains personal health information and must be managed in compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR. Key challenges include integrating diverse datasets and ensuring data accuracy since the screening programs could be organised on national or regional level. Additionally, the risks and benefits of screening programs must be balanced.

Cancer diagnosis\nDescription\nA cancer patient's journey starts with a confirmed diagnosis, which involves clinical evaluation, imaging, laboratory tests, and testing of molecular biomarkers by different methods (e.g. immunohistochemistry, next-generation sequencing, in situ hybridisation) in biopsies (e.g. tissue or liquid biopsies) to confirm malignancy and assess tumour characteristics. Cancer diagnosis is a multi-step process that begins with a patient's clinical presentation, such as symptoms or incidental findings during routine check-ups or specialized screening programs (e.g. mammography for breast cancer, FIT tests and consequent colonoscopy for colorectal cancer, Pap smears and HPV PCR for cervical cancer). If cancer is suspected, the diagnostic journey typically involves a combination of medical imaging (CT, MRI, PET scans, ultrasound), laboratory tests, and biopsy procedures to confirm malignancy, each step producing a different data type.",

Although cancer treatment data is crucial for developing personalized medicine approaches, improving patient outcomes and advancing research, comprehensive documentation of cancer treatment data remains limited in cancer registries and public datasets.

In addition, while cancer treatment data publication has increased, it remains inconsistent due to the lack of data standardization along with sparse ontologies. The increasing use of electronic health records across western countries, along with standardized cancer classification systems (e.g. WHO, ICD, CAP), staging systems (e.g. {% tool \"uicc-tnm\" %} ), and pioneering drug (e.g. DRON PDRO) and side effects (e.g. OAE) ontologies, facilitates data collection.",

In this context, the increasing adoption of digital health technologies, including wearable devices and mobile health applications, as well as Artificial Intelligence and predictive analytics, has transformed post-treatment monitoring. On one hand, it has enabled real-time remote tracking of health metrics (e.g. physical activity, heart rate, sleep patterns etc), facilitating early detection of potential complications and on the other hand help anticipate complications and tailor follow-up schedules to individual patients' needs. Both scenarios lead to generation of diverse data types. Additionally, cancer registries (CRs) and clinical trial databases play a fundamental role in storing longitudinal data on disease progression, survival rates, and treatment efficacy, allowing researchers to analyze trends, identify recurrence risk factors, and refine personalized follow-up guidelines.",

It also provides an important link with the genomics and structural biology communities. One objective of structural bioinformatics is the creation of new methods of analysis and manipulation of biological macromolecular data in order to predict their structures, function and interactions. Currently, atomic structures of macromolecules can be obtained both based on experimental and computational methods. This document describes guidelines to deposit computationally or experimentally solved structure models together with relevant metadata according to FAIR principles.",

Thermodynamic parameters such as the equilibrium constant and standard Gibbs or metabolic energy of the reaction are properties only of the complete chemical reaction catalysed, yet worth mentioning in biocatalyst characterisation because they can limit reaction rate, yield and efficiency. Similarly, the process conditions have a major effect on the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. The parameters are calculated from a series of experimental raw data. Enzyme activity data are widely distributed in the literature and databases and are used when inferring and comparing reaction specificity and mechanisms, when comparing enzymes from various organisms, when trying to understand the physiological function of an enzyme and when making dynamic pathway models to understand genome function. Biochemical parameter values vary with the conditions around the biocatalyst.",

The functional data of enzyme kinetics and biocatalysis is a much-reduced set, typically comprising kinetic and thermodynamic parameters such as equilibrium dissociation constants and Michaelis-Menten and catalytic constants. These parameters completely pin down mathematical models for the biocatalysts. These models then enable the calculation of the rate of the reaction catalysed by the enzyme for a wide range of concentrations of substrates, products, modifiers, pH values and temperatures. A frequent example of such a model is the reversible Michaelis-Menten equation. The appropriateness of this model for the description of the biocatalyst function is often uncertain or an approximation. It is important that the model used is validated for the biocatalyst under consideration.

Considerations\n\nAre there particular characteristics of your dataset that would restrict the choice of applicable tools? Are the recommended tools freely available? If not, can you afford the software licensing cost? If not, are there freely available alternatives? Does your institution have its own HPC facilities, and what are the access conditions?

Considerations\n\nFormat of designs may vary depending on the application, whether this be at the sequence level or an entire system. Consider existing management tools that can help visualise and modify genetic designs. Think about how the information about the characterisation of genetic constructs assist in the selection of parts and modelling designs.

Build: methods - documentation and (meta)data publication\nDescription\nThe build stage in the microbial biotechnology and\/or synthetic biology life cycle involves the application of any number of a range of experimental techniques and, since these techniques are so varied, the domain is therefore very difficult to standardise in terms of the data and metadata to be shared. The current method of sharing information about the building of microbial systems is to write a detailed free text in the materials and methods section of a scientific paper. Considerations:\n\nCapturing the information about the build process involves collecting the information arising from DNA amplification, DNA preparation and purification, primer design, restriction enzyme analysis, gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing to name but a few techniques. If using a protein expression device, the intended vector for its replication in a given host will need to be named.",

The “Garbage in, Garbage out” principle (GIGO) has to be kept in mind at this stage: models trained on unreliable data will produce unreliable predictions {% cite sansone2023FAIR %}. To prepare data for ML models, several steps need to be followed. Firstly, data should be collected from reliable and diverse resources, ensuring it represents the problem domain accurately. Then, data cleaning techniques such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and addressing outliers should be applied to enhance data quality. A commonly used practice for this task is the implementation of {% tool \"scikit-learn\" %}. Regarding features, on one hand there is the selection or extraction that can be performed to identify the most relevant and informative attributes for the model {% cite comess2020Bringing %}. On the other hand, there is the problem of the number of features which exceeds that of observations due to the nature of data in life sciences {% cite berisha2021Digital %}.",

For instance, the theory of the domain can be applied to get a subset of features that are proven to be related to the target variable. Principal components analysis (PCA) and likewise methods do not result in domain-specific features but increase the model's general ability by reducing its variance. ML models take only numeric values as input with some exceptions (e.g. {% tool \"catboost\" %}). Categorical data has to be encoded into numbers via various strategies. The simplest is one-hot encoding. Namely, a new feature per every level of a categorical variable is created and the relation of that level to a particular observation is encoded with 1 (observation has this level of a variable) or 0. The drawback of this method is that the feature number is increased if the categorical variable has many levels.",

Other methods include label\/ordinal encoding, target encoding, frequency encoding, and vectorisation (for text data). It is always a good idea to encode a variable in a way where encoding has a meaning which can help a model to recognise patterns in the data. For example, a variable storing temperature values with levels cold, warm, and hot can be encoded with 1 (cold), 2 (warm), and 3 (hot). However, the context of the task has to be considered in this case. Before dropping anomalies from the data, it is required to determine their nature and whether it is possible to convert them to regular values with a high level of confidence. Augmentation allows artificially increasing the diversity of the data by realistic data points to improve performance (decreasing overfitting, resolving class imbalance, rare events prediction) of the ML model or reducing the cost of data collection.

Data integration and reuse are facilitators for understanding the play between genotype and environment to produce a phenotype, which requires integrating phenotyping experiments and genomic assays made on the same plant material with geo-climatic data. Moreover, cross-species comparisons are often necessary to understand the mechanisms behind phenotypic traits, especially at the genotypic level, due to the gap in genomic knowledge between well-studied plant species (namely Arabidopsis) and newly sequenced ones.

It encompasses a variety of species, ranging from model organisms to crop species to wild plants such as forest trees. These often need to be detailed at infra-specific levels (e.g. subspecies, variety), but naming at these levels sometimes lacks consensus. Studies can take place in a diversity of settings, including indoor (e.g. growth chamber, greenhouse) and outdoor settings (e.g. cultivated field, forest) which differ fundamentally on the requirements and manner of characterizing the environment. Phenotypic data can be collected manually or automatically (by sensors and drones), and be very diverse in nature, spanning physical measurements, the results of biochemical assays, and images. Some omics data can be considered as well as molecular phenotypes (e.g. transcriptome, metabolomes). Thus, the extension and depth of metadata required to describe a plant experiment in a FAIR-compliant way is very demanding for researchers.",

Observer-Reported Outcome Measure (ObsROM) is a measurement based on a report of observable signs, events or behaviours related to a patient’s health condition by someone (e.g. family member or caregiver) other than the patient or a health professional.

When COMs from a participant are gathered across multiple time points, the study is categorised as a longitudinal study.

It is useful to keep in mind that EHRs are healthcare-oriented electronic tools with a data model design and functionalities intended for critical healthcare operations and not for research. Therefore, specific standards and methods to extract and transform this information are required to allow such use ethically and legally.

The proposed regulation establishes a common space for health data where:\n* Individuals are empowered through increased digital access to and control of their electronic personal health data\n* Researchers, innovators and policymakers can request access to these electronic health data in a trusted and secure way that preserves the individual’s personal data\nThe EHDS will also regulate the interoperability of EHRs to a certain extent, in particular to facilitate the exchange of the patient summary data. EHDS places a significant emphasis on promoting the secondary use of health data, to serve research, innovation, policy-making and regulatory purposes. To achieve this, several European initiatives have been launched to establish its foundation and define guiding principles. Among these endeavors, two signification projects stand out:\n* TEHDAS, the joint action Towards the European Health Data Space, helped develop and promote concepts for the secondary use of health data to benefit public health and health research and innovation in Europe.",

It is about thinking upfront what's the best way to avoid problems or unexpected costs related to data management, and set the conditions for your research data to achieve the highest possible impact in science, even after the end of the project. Solutions regarding the handling of the data generated within a project is usually formalised in a Data Management Plan (DMP). A DMP is a document describing several aspects of the data management process which occur before, during and after the end of a project (see the Data Management Plan page). Why is data management planning important? It is good research practice to take care of your research data and have a DMP. It will make your work more efficient, facilitate team work and use of services and tools.",

Reuse of data is particularly important in science, as it allows different researchers to analyse and publish findings based on the same data independently of one another. Reusability is one key component of the FAIR principles. Data that is well-described, curated and shared under clear terms and conditions is more likely to be reused. Integration with other data sources is also important, since that can enable new, yet unanticipated, uses for the data. Why is data reuse important? By reusing existing data you can:\n\nobtain reference data for your research;\navoid doing new, unnecessary experiments;\nrun analyses to verify that reported findings are correct, and thereby making subsequent findings more robust;\nmake research more robust by aggregating results obtained from different methods or samples;\ngain novel insights by connecting and meta-analysing datasets.",

A starting point can be to look for value added databases with curated content. Other possibilities include searching data deposition repositories for suitable datasets based on their annotation, or obtaining data directly from the author of a scientific article. Check under which terms and conditions the data is shared. Make sure that there is a licence, and that the licence gives you permission to do what you intend to. Check whether there is sufficient metadata to enable data reuse. Some types of data can be straightforward to reuse (e.g. genome data), while other may require extensive metadata to interpret and reuse (e.g. gene expression experiment data).

This can either be individual earlier collected datasets, reference data from curated resources or consensus data like reference genomes. For more information see Reuse in the data life cycle. Why is data collection important? Apart from being the source of information to build your findings on, the collection phase lays the foundation for the quality of both the data and its documentation.

Data preservation consists of a series of activities necessary to ensure safety, integrity and accessibility of data for as long as necessary, even decades. Data preservation is indeed more than just data storage and backup, since data can be stored and backed up without being preserved. Data preservation prevents data from becoming unavailable and unusable over time through appropriate steps. * Ensure data safety and integrity. * Change the file format (format migration) and update software to make sure that they do not become outdated or obsolete. * Change hardware and other storage media (such as paper, magnetic tape, etc.) to avoid degradation. * Ensure that data is organised and described with appropriate metadata and documentation to be always understandable and reusable.

In a collaborative project, being able to easily share data makes research more efficient. Sharing of data is a cornerstone of good science. It is a good research practice to ensure that data underlying research is preserved and made available to the research community and society at large. Sharing data is a prerequisite for making your research reproducible. To be useful for others, you should strive to make the shared data adhere to the FAIR principles. In the European Union, the 'Open Data Directive' (Directive (EU) 2019\/1024) states that \"Member States shall support the availability of research data by adopting national policies and relevant actions aiming at making publicly funded research data openly available (‘open access policies’), following the principle of ‘open by default’ and compatible with the FAIR principles.",

Data analysis consists in exploring the collected data to begin understanding the messages contained in a dataset and\/or in applying mathematical formula (or models) to identify relationships between variables. The steps of the workflow in the analysis phase will often be repeated several times to explore the data as well as to optimize the workflow itself. According to the different types of data (quantitative or qualitative) the data analysis methods will differ. Data analysis follows the (often automated, batch) data processing stage. Why is data analysis important?\nSince data analysis is the stage where new knowledge and information are generated, it can be considered as central in the research process. Because of the relevance of the data analysis stage in research findings, it is essential that the analysis workflow applied to a dataset complies with the FAIR principles.",

Moreover, it is extremely important that the analysis workflow is reproducible by other researchers and scientists. With many disciplines becoming data-oriented, more data intensive projects will arise which will require experts from dedicated fields. What should be considered for data analysis? Because of the diversity of domains and technologies in Life Sciences, data can be either \"small\" or \"big data\". As a consequence, the methods and technical solutions used for data analysis might differ. The characteristics of \"big data\" are often summarized by a growing list of \"V\" properties: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability, Veracity, Visualization and Value. The data analysis stage relies on the previous stages (collection, processing) that will lay the foundations for the generation of new knowledge by providing accurate and trustworthy data. The location of your data is important because of the need of proximity with computing resources.",

It is worthwhile to compare the cost of the transfer of massive amounts of data compared to the transfer of virtual images of machines for the analysis. For the analysis of data, you will first have to consider the computing environment and choose between several computing infrastructure types, e.g. cluster, cloud. You will also need to select the appropriate work environment according to your needs and expertise (command line, web portal). You will have to select the tools best suited for the analysis of your data. It is important to document the exact steps used for data analysis. This includes the version of the software used, as well as the parameters used, as well as the computing environment. Manual \"manipulation\" of the data may complicate this documentation process.

Additional tools that comprise the core of the FAIRtracks ecosystem are the\nmetadata validation and the\nmetadata augmentation services. The former is REST API that extends the standard JSON Schema validation technology to\ne.g. validate ontology terms or check CURIEs against the registered entries. The FAIRtracks augmentation service\nis implemented as a REST API that expands on the information contained in a minimal FAIRtracks JSON by adding\na set of fields with human-readable values including ontology labels, versions, and summaries.

IFB and the underlying infrastructure are accessible to researchers in France and their foreign collaborators. Researchers that would like to know more about IFB services can find specific contact details at the unified IFB help desk page and get support through the dedicated help pages. Depending on the resources, fees may apply. It is therefore advisable to contact them during the planning phase of the project. The way you can access the IFB depends on the type of resources (for instance, cluster or cloud), and there will be different authentication procedures (local, national or international). For example, the Biosphere cloud federation uses the EduGAIN federation for authentication, while useGalaxy.fr uses the {% tool \"life-science-login\" %} authentication.

This entails GDPR-compliant and secure data collection, storage, curation, standardisation integration and analysis of clinical data and associated molecular, imaging and sensor\/mobile data and metadata. TransMed tool assembly is also a blueprint showing how a collection of tools can be combined to support data lifecycle management in clinical and translational projects. Who can use the TransMed data and computing tool assembly? All researchers can use tools in the TransMed assembly individually or in combination depending on their project needs.

Therefore, data management planning of this type of projects needs to take data protection and GDPR compliance into account . Typically a TransMed project involves  multiple (clinical) study sites and can contain several cohorts. During the planning phase the dataflow for the project and data\/metadata collected prospectively or retrospectively needs to be documented. Projects can use the Data Information Sheet DISH to map the project dataflow and collect metadata necessary for GDPR-compliant processing. In addition, a data protection impact assessment needs to be performed taking into account partner roles, responsibilities and the data information collected via the DISH.",

It can store, organize and manage highly heterogeneous (e.g. images, spectra, growth curves) and multi-spatial and temporal scale data (leaf to canopy level) originating from multiple sources (field, greenhouse). It unambiguously identifies all objects and traits in an experiment and establishes their relations via ontologies and semantics that apply to both field and controlled conditions. Its ontology-driven architecture is a powerful tool for integrating and managing data from multiple experiments and platforms, for creating relationships between objects and enriching datasets with knowledge and metadata. It is MIAPPE and BrAPI compliant, and naming conventions are recommended for users to declare their resources. Several experimental platforms use PHIS to manage their data, and PHIS instances dedicated to sharing resources (projects, genetic resources, variables) also exist to allow the sharing of studied concepts.",

DMPs created in DMPTuuli are not yet machine-actionable or linked to the CSC data management tool assembly services. However, a DMP is a valuable document when contacting and using the CSC research data management services. Other available DMP tools include {%tool \"data-stewardship-wizard\" %} and {%tool \"dmponline\" %}.

Allas can be used both for static research data that needs to be available for analysis and to collect cumulating data. For example, if you work with sequence data, the sequencing provider can transfer the data directly to Allas under your project. However, as an object storage system, Allas is not suitable for very dynamic data like SQL databases. Data processing and analysis\nFor processing, analysing and storing data during the research project, CSC offers several computing platforms. These include both environments for non-sensitive and sensitive data.

MOLGENIS enables you to quickly create explorers for your data sets and variables to the outside world while preventing exposure of (sensitive) data values using the fine-grained permission system. Example: http:\/\/www.palgaopenbaredatabank.nl\nSecure access\nEasily control group, role and individual access. MOLGENIS data is organised following scientific practice. Data can be divided in research groups, within the groups you can assign roles such as 'data manager', 'data editor' and 'data user'. Authentication can be ensured by connecting you institute account via SURFconext (NL) and BBMRI\/LS Login (Europe) or using Google two-factor authentication. Scripting & visualisation\nBioinformaticians can take full control in MOLGENIS. Add scripts in your favorite programming languages (e.g. R, javascript, python) and connect to the data using API's to add great analysis tools and views.",

Data in the second (NeLS) layer is protected against hardware failure on disk or server level and snapshots of the data are kept for 4 weeks. The third layer is implemented on top of the national research data storage solutions operated by Sigma2 Uninett A\/S and is protected against data loss by snapshots and geo-replication.

The plant genomics tool assembly is a toolkit for managing plant genomics and genotyping data throughout their life cycle, with a particular focus on ensuring traceability of the biological material to enable interoperability with plant phenotyping data. To enable this, the same persistent identifiers must be used in both the genotyping and phenotyping experiments. It is recommended that the biological plant material is accurately described using rich metadata and stored in a central repository. The tool assembly also provides guidance on how users should structure their analysis results in the form of VCF files to achieve a higher degree of interoperability.

Description\nEthical issues refer to moral principles and standards that guide human conduct and define what is considered right or wrong within a particular context. Considerations\n\n\nThere are different aspects in the management of research data that can raise ethical issues. It is important to distinguish between ethical issues and legal behaviour. Ethical standards may vary across cultures, disciplines, and professional organisations. Researchers are expected to adhere to these ethical principles even if certain practices are not explicitly prohibited by law. Often these standards are collected in declarations and guidelines, which may be backed by laws. Legal behaviour, on the other hand, refers to compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies. Legal requirements provide a baseline level of conduct that researchers must meet to avoid legal sanctions. However, legal compliance does not necessarily guarantee ethical behaviour.",

Considerations\n\n\nCreation of scientific data can be a costly process. For a research project to receive funding one needs to justify, in the project’s data management plan, the need for data creation and why reuse is not possible. Therefore it is advised to always check first if there exists suitable data to reuse for your project.

In enterprise context, it often refers to master data management as defined by the ISO 8000 standards. In science, the quality of data is closely linked to the suitability of the data for (re)use for a particular purpose and it is a key attribute of research data. Data quality affects the reliability of research results and it is a key factor increasing the reusability of data for secondary research. Data quality control can take place at any stage during the research data lifecycle. That said, you should ensure that the necessary procedures are defined during data management planning. Considerations\nQuality control is most typically performed during data collection but it should not be neglected in later stages of research data lifecycle.",

Consider familiarising yourself with data quality standards or established working practices in your field of study.

Kahn also proposes two different modes to evaluate these components:\nverification (focusing on the intrinsic consistency, such as adherence to a format or specified value range);\nvalidation (focusing on the alignment of values with respect to external benchmarks). For health data, a nice example of working out what data quality means can be found in the {% tool \"ohdsi\" %} community.

For some studies there is a cohort owner, often a clinical party or a trusted third party that can map study participant keys back to names and surnames. Such data is considered pseudonymous. If there are no means to map the data back to individuals, then the data is considered anonymous and is out of the scope of the GDPR. You should keep in mind that anonymising data is a notoriously difficult task. Does your dataset contain a wide array of attributes, or exhibit unique traits\/patterns such that one can reasonably expect that not more than a dozen people in the world have those together? In that case, you can not assume that it is anonymous. Such data run the risk of being linked back to individuals through various technical means. You need to take into account that technical means to identify people in the future may be more powerful than than they are right now: i.e. data that is anonymous right now may not be anonymous forever.",

While Data Management Plans (DMPs) can span tens or even hundreds of pages, a diagram offers a more concise and accessible way to represent your data-flow. This visual approach helps bridge the gap between partners who may have varying perceptions and levels of understanding, ensuring everyone is aligned. Diagrams make it easier to identify potential issues by highlighting undocumented data sources or destinations that might otherwise go unnoticed in a lengthy document. A well-crafted data-flow diagram also boosts the engagement of less-involved partners or stakeholders, giving them a clear and intuitive way to contribute to the planning process.

For complex project with multiple steps, data sources, or stakeholders, a diagram is invaluable for identifying steps, dependencies, potential issues and ensuring everyone has a shared understanding. The more complex the data-flow, the more time and effort it will take to create and update the diagram. It is important to plan carefully and ensure that the time invested in diagram creation and updates is manageable and that your contribution is clearly recognized. A diagram may include sensitive or confidential information or reveal critical details that could be exploited by attackers, such as system vulnerabilities or data access points.

Solutions\nHere, we provide some advice and methods to help consortia with data management coordination tasks:\n\nIn a consortium, establishing a Data Management Working Group (DMWG) should be one of the first actions taken during the establishment of the consortium. Each partner should have representatives for data management, especially the partners that will generate and\/or use a higher volume of data. If possible, the representatives should have a working knowledge of data management. During the writing stage, the DMWG should be responsible for deciding how data management will be addressed during (and after) the project. It is highly recommended that, if possible, the establishment of the DMWG is included as a project task, deliverable or milestone. Each partner should allocate personnel time for the DMWG.

Description\nIf you want to secure a constant effort on research data management across the project period and after the project, with stable data quality, this will require dedicated monitoring and focus from the project management and the DMWG. Considerations\n\nBe aware of a possible lack of storage infrastructure, thus requiring financing that might not be part of the initially proposed project budget. Monitor that data is not lost, e.g. by missing or unimplemented backup procedures. Monitor that metadata is collected, and organised according to agreed standards and no discrepancies between metadata and reality exist (e.g. sample ID mismatches). Copyright licenses connected to the reuse of the project outputs should be applicable long-term beyond the project's lifetime.

You might want to consult a data preservation service (e.g. national data centres) regarding larger amounts of data. As an initial inspiration, you can start from this data value checklist and adapt it for your legal framework and domain. Do not leave the data holders with the impossible task of trying to figure out who can have access to the resources, but rather use a license that allows the re-use of data. For instance, some projects or funding bodies demand to use CC-BY-4.0 and refrain from using bespoke, non-standard license terms.

For instance, have you ever tried to extract or copy-paste a table from a PDF into a spreadsheet? It is usually very difficult and sometimes even impossible. This is a practical example of why PDF is not easy to read by machines, but it is very easy to read by humans. This occurs because the content in a PDF is described as “characters painted or drawn on a space”. So text is not text and tables are not tables for a PDF. They are just characters on the page space. Tabular data in CSV file can be quite easy to read by humans, unless the table is very very big.

Description\nNumerous research institutes have already introduced or are going to introduce the use of Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN), Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) or similar systems to manage samples, reagents, metadata and data, during a research project. The reason for this is that this software could organize information in a structured way and make (meta)data “more” machine-actionable, compared to traditional lab books or individual folders and files in a computer.",

CSV is appropriate to exchange plain text information in a tabular format, but its flat nature makes a challenge to describe more complex relationships between information. XML and JSON formats are widely used for data exchange between systems (such as softwares, platforms or hardwares) and on the web. Both are easy to read and interpreted by machines, but not very human-readable. Exchange file formats using key-value pairs, such as .xml and .json, can wrap or encode the information to be sent or exchanged in a hierarchical (tree) data model. XML is a markup language. It is based on “elements” enclosed by pairs of “tags” and “attributes” (<tag>element<tag>). It is self-explanatory because it contains metadata about the format and “tags” are chosen by the creator of the .xml file. For instance, <name>Jaguar<name>. JSON format can be easily read in any programming language. It is based on key-value pairs separated by colons ( {key:value} ). For instance, { name: “Jaguar” }.",

The W3C consortium has formalised a universal abstract data model to potentially establish relationships among any resource available on the web (people, places, web pages, events, abstract concepts, etc.) called Resource Description Framework (RDF). This universal abstract data model allows us to describe relationships between multiple resources encoded in different formats, following different standards and stored in different locations\/servers on the internet. RDF model consists of sentences in the form of “Subject” →  “Predicate” → “Object”, called Triples, that describe the relationship between different pieces of information. An example could be “Jaguar” → “is in” → “Jungle”. Subject and Object can be any resource available on the internet, Predicate (properties) connects resources to other resources or data values, etc.\n\nRDF concept can be written and applied to databases using different syntaxes, such as N-Triples, Turtle,  RDF\/XML, RDFa, JSON-LD.",

Some reasons can be that the data has to be pre-processed or enriched to comply with legal or organisational practices, that the data has to be translated to different data formats, or that transferring data requires expertise and access to special interfaces. By acting as a broker, you can fill this gap by negotiating a contract with data providers and\/or recipients and doing the work required to make it convenient for them to exchange data. {: height=\"500px\" width=\"500px\"}\nFigure 1: Data Brokering Workflow.

Collecting and processing the metadata and data\nDescription\nData brokering involves collecting data from various data providers (metadata and other data e.g. sequencing files), standardising and curating the data if needed, and then preparing the data for re-sharing e.g. in public international repositories. On the brokering platform, it is recommended that data be stored in a structured manner (e.g. in a relational database), using as much as possible controlled vocabularies and ontologies where they exist. Considerations\n\nData collection should be carefully prepared, notably to define the data model, the metadata and data that are needed for the envisioned applications, assess which fields should be compulsory or optional, follow controlled vocabularies or ontologies, and identify the nature of data (personal, sensitive data) and thereby the required level of security or data treatment (e.g. pseudonymised or anonymised data, ethical consent…).",

Collection of metadata can be done in various ways, each having its advantages and disadvantages, notably in terms of user-friendliness, ease of processing and data quality.

Regular data checks should always be performed at the database level, to check unicity of identifiers where expected (e.g. sample identifier within a laboratory is expected to be unique) and identify potential incoherences in the data (e.g. division indicated in the name of a virus versus division indicated in the location field).

It is at the same time very convenient for batch uploads and users generally like having a file that they can store and easily re-open to check what they have provided. Text files (e.g. TSV, CSV, JSON, XML, and so on) are very practical to automate batch submissions on the user side, since scripts can easily generate these files.

Sharing data to public repositories\nDescription\nOften, a goal of the broker is to publish the collected and harmonised data in an open archive for the benefit of both the data owners and the wider scientific community. This supports sharing data with collaborators, referencing for publication and provides a long-term storage solution. Once relevant repositories are identified for data submission and sharing, being an official data broker for a repository will generally give you additional rights such as the possibility to submit data on behalf of data producers, as well as providing a list of authors and address of the data providers.",

Description\nBeing able to reliably measure and document capabilities in data management, data protection and information security is important for research institutions. By knowing their capabilities institutions can spot areas of improvement and direct human and IT resources accordingly. Also, having capabilities documented or formalised by certifications saves a good deal of effort during data management planning. Considerations\n\nAre you being asked to describe information security and data protection arrangements for a project DMP and you find yourself repeating similar descriptions across DMPs of projects?

ABS is not relevant for all genetic resources. It applies only to resources that have been accessed from a provider country after October 12, 2014. Some genetic resources are explicitly excluded, like for example human genomes, some crops and some viruses. Moreover, there are countries who are party of the Nagoya Protocol, but have no ABS legislation in place. If ABS is relevant to the project it should be part of the Data Management Plan. You must comply with the Nagoya Protocol and other national legislation before accessing the genetic resources.

Initially, researchers browse online catalogues that describe studies, datasets, related publications, variables, and some data distributions.

However, to find dataset that meet specific combinations of attributes — such as identifying datasets with particular combinations of attributes, like 'adults diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last year, fully vaccinated, with no underlying health conditions' (for example) — researchers must either contact the authors or request data access and verify themselves.

This includes, but not limited to, parameters such as phenotypes, disease codes, sex, or age, providing researchers with a nuanced approach to data inquiries. Beacon v2 is organised in two main blocks: the Beacon Framework and the Beacon Model. The Framework defines the format for the requests and responses, whereas the Model defines the structure of the biological data response. This dual-system approach not only broadens the scope for diverse Models – using different domains such as images, pathogens, or infectious diseases – but also reinforces the adaptability of the Framework. The overall function of these components is to provide the instructions to design a REST API that could be implemented as a stand-alone product or, preferably, extending existing data management solutions.",

You should estimate these costs and address the resources needed in your data management plan. Considerations\n\nBudgeting and costing for your data management is often dependent upon local and temporal circumstances, institutional resources, services, and policies. You have to take into account even items such as investments (site services, infrastructure), operations (network, electricity, maintenance) and personnel costs.

        "content":"What features do you need in a storage solution when collecting data? Description\nThe need for Data storage arises early on in a research project, as space will be required to put your data when starting collection or generation. Therefore, it is a good practice to think about storage solutions during the data management planning phase, and request storage in advance and\/or pay for it. The storage solution for your data should fulfil certain criteria (e.g. space, access & transfer speed, duration of storage, etc.), which should be discussed with the IT team. You may choose a tiered storage system for assigning data to various types of storage media based on requirements for access, performance, recovery and cost. Using tiered storage allows you to classify data according to levels of importance and assign it to the appropriate storage tiers or move it to different tier for e.g. once analysis is completed you have the option to move data to lower tier for preservation or archiving.",

This storage is usually located in close proximity to the user such as on campus and incurs high costs. “Cold” storage is associated with low access speed and frequency and consists of slower drives or tapes. This storage is usually off-premises and incurs low cost. Considerations\nWhen looking for solutions to store your data during the collection or generation phase, you should consider the following aspects. The volume of your data is an important discerning factor to determine the appropriate storage solution. At the minimum, try to estimate the volume of raw data that you are going to generate or collect. What kind of access\/transfer speed and access frequency will be required for your data.

However, it can be difficult to be able to estimate the amount of computational resource needed for a process or an analysis. Considerations\nBelow, you can find some aspects that you need to consider to be able to estimate the computational resource needed for data processing and analysis. The volume of total data is an important discerning factor to estimate the computational resources needed. Consider how much data volume you need “concurrently or at once”. For example, consider the possibility to analyse a large dataset by downloading or accessing only a subset of the data at a  time (e.g., stream 1 TB at a time from a big dataset of 500 TB). Define the expected speed and the reliability of connection between storage and compute. Determine which software you are going to use. If it is a proprietary software, you should check possible licensing issues. Check if it only runs on specific operative systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux,…). Establish if and what reference datasets you need.",

Description\nAfter the end of the project, all the relevant (meta)data (to guarantee reproducibility) should be preserved for a certain amount of time, that is usually defined by funders or institution policy. However, where to preserve data that are not needed for active processing or analysis anymore is a common question in data management. Considerations\n\nData preservation doesn’t refer to a place nor to a specific storage solution, but rather to the way or “how” data can be stored. As described in our Preservation page, numerous precautions need to be implemented by people with a variety of technical skills to preserve data. Estimate the volume of the (meta)data files that need to be preserved after the end of the project. Consider using a compressed file format to minimize the data volume. Define the amount of time (hours, days…) that you could wait in case the data needs to be reanalysed in the future.",

Description\nProvenance is the documentation of why and how the data (but also datasets, computational analysis and other research output) was produced, where, when and by whom.

Data provenance\/lineage means tracing the movements and the changes of the data that occurred between their origin and their destination system. Well-documented data provenance is essential for assessing authenticity, credibility, trustworthiness, quality (it helps finding errors) and reusability of data, as well as the reproducibility of the results.

Description\nA lot of (meta)data is collected in the form of tables, representing quantitative or qualitative measurements (values in cells) of certain named properties (variables in columns) of a range of subjects or samples (records or observations in rows). It can help your research a lot if you make sure you can address each of these records, variables and values unambiguously, i.e. if each has a unique identifier. This is also true for (meta)data that is not in tabular format (“key”:value format, unstructured data, etc.). Identifiers should always be used for metadata and data independently of the format. If the research institute or group has a centralised and structured system (such as a central electronic database) in place to describe and store (meta)data, this process can be quite straightforward for the researcher.",

However, if there is no such system, often researchers have to set up an internal “database” to keep track of each record or observation in a study.

The use of identifiers for records, variables and values will increase the reusability and interoperability of the data for you, your future self and others. Considerations\n\nAt the beginning of your research project, check if your institute or research group has a centralised database where data must be entered during data collection. Usually, large and international research projects, industries, research institutes or hospitals have a centralised electronic database, an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) or an Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) with a user interface for data entry.",

Description\nOften, research in Life Sciences generates massive amounts of digital data, such as output files of ‘omics’ techniques (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, etc.). Large data files cannot be sent by email because they exceed the file size limit of most common email servers. Moreover, some data cannot be sent by email due to its sensitive nature. So, how can large data files be transferred from a local computer to a distant one? Considerations\nThere are many aspects to consider when dealing with data transfer. The size or volume of the data and the capacity or bandwidth of the network that links your local computer with the distant computer are crucial aspects. Data size and bandwidth are tightly linked since transferring large volumes of data on a low bandwidth network will be so time consuming that it could be simpler to send the data on a hard drive through carrier services.",

Consider pros and cons of transferring data by shipping hard disks through carrier services (time, costs, security). This is not a recommended method, unless good internet connection is not available. During a transfer, some data might become corrupted. Thus, it is important to check if the files you transferred have conserved their integrity. This can be done with hash algorithms. A checksum file is calculated for each file before transfer and compared to a checksum calculated on the transferred files. If the checksums are the same, then the files are not corrupted.",

Solutions\nPreferable transfer channel depends on the volume of your data and number of files. However, there are several general approaches to help you with the task. * Try to optimise and ease your data transfer by archiving your data in a single file. This can be done with two tools available on most systems. * tar (tape archive) will create an archive, a single file containing several files or directories. * gzip: since tar does not compress the archive created, a compression tool such as gzip is often used to reduce the size of the archive.

Description\nData documentation could be defined as the clear description of everything that a new “data user” or “your future-self” would need to know in order to find, understand, reproduce and reuse your data, independently. Data documentation should clearly describe how you generated or used the data, why, and where to find the related files. It could be used also as onboarding documentation for new colleagues, even if the responsible researcher leaves the project. Due to the large variety of experiments, techniques and collaborative studies that usually occur within the same project, it is challenging to keep good documentation. However, lack of good data documentation often leads to data loss, not reproducible results and therefore, waste of money and time for scientists.

Considerations\n\n\nWrite the documentation in such a way that someone else who is known to the field cannot misinterpret any of the data. It is best practice to use one appropriate tool or an integration of multiple tools (also called tool assembly or ecosystem) for data documentation during a project. Suitable tools for data documentation are Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs), Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems, Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). Moreover, online platforms for collaborative research and file sharing services (such as {% tool \"openscienceframework\" %}) could also be used as ELN or data management systems. Check with your institute or other relevant infrastructures to know what is offered. Independently of the tools you will use, data documentation is needed at two levels: documentation about the entire study or project and documentation about individual records, observations or data points.",

LIMS are used to document and track biological samples through the experimental processes and can support direct import of data from sources such as instruments. Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems are usually designated for collection of clinical trial data. Online platforms for collaborative research and file sharing services, which integrate with several data management tools, could also be used for data documentation during the project. For instance, {% tool \"openscienceframework\" %} has integrations with Mendeley, {% tool \"dropbox\" %}, {% tool \"github\" %}, {% tool \"figshare\" %}, etc. There is a major area of overlap between the aforementioned tools for data documentation, so it is better to choose the tool(s) that best address your specific need. Some tools can be used at the same time to address different needs and they can be complementary.",

Used wisely, they can enable both humans and computers to understand your data. There is no clear-cut division between the terms \"vocabulary\" and \"ontology\", but the latter is more commonly used when dealing with complex (and perhaps more formal) collections of terms and relationships.

Perhaps the repository where you are about to submit your data have recommendations? Or the journal where you plan to publish your results?\nUnderstand your goal with sharing data. Which formal requirements (by e.g. by funder or publisher) need to be fulfilled? Which parts of your data would benefit the most from adopting ontologies? Learn the basics about ontologies. This will be helpful when you search for terms in ontologies and want to understand how terms are related to one another. Accept that one ontology may not be sufficient to describe your data.

A file name is the principal identifier for a file and a good name gives information what the file contains and helps in sorting them, but only if you have been consistent with the naming. Considerations\n\nBest practice is to develop a file naming convention with elements that are important to your project already when the project starts. When working in collaboration with others, it is important to follow the same file naming convention. Solutions\nTips for naming files\n\nBalance with the amount of elements: too many makes it difficult to understand vs too few makes it general. Order the elements from general to specific. Use meaningful abbreviations. Use underscore (_), hyphen (- ) or capitalized letters to separate elements in the name. Don’t use spaces or special characters: ?!& , * % # ; * ( ) @$ ^ ~ ‘ { } [ ] < >.",

Considerations\nWhen making a selection for an appropriate file format, you should consider the following factors whenever feasible:\n- non-proprietary;\n- based on open standard;\n- commonly used in your research domain;\n- uncompressed;\n- unencrypted. It is important to differentiate between file formats intended for active phase (data acquisition, data reduction and primary data analysis) and those designed for long-term storage or reuse (sharing, publishing and archiving).

Description\nFile versioning is a way to keep track of changes made to files and datasets. While the implementation of a good file naming convention will indicate that different versions exist, this will not explain the difference between two (or more) versions. File versioning will enable transparency about which actions and changes were made and when. This makes it easy to backtrack and find something that was present in a previous version, but was later deleted or changed. Considerations\n\nDo you need to collaborate on files, perhaps at the same time? Is there a need to be able to backtrack and restore a previous version? Will there be many changes made? Solutions\n\nSmaller demands of versioning can be managed manually e.g. by keeping a log where the changes for each respective file is documented, version by version.",

This will help to tackle reproducibility problems but also will improve the impact of your research through collaborations with scientists who will reproduce your in silico experiments. Considerations\nThere are many ways that will bring reproducibility to your data analysis.

Tips and tricks to navigate the landscape of software package management solutions:\nManage the software you need in an OS-independent way by listing all relevant packages in your Conda environment via the environment.yaml file. If you need conflicting versions of some tools\/libraries for different operations, make separate Conda environments. If you need a few open source libraries for your Python script, none of which require compiling, make a requirements.txt and reference pip packages. How can you use container environments?\nDescription\nContainer environments like {% tool \"docker\" %} or {% tool \"singularity\" %} allow you to easily install specific versions of tools, even older ones, in an isolated environment. Considerations\nIn short containers works almost like a virtual machine (VMs), in that it re-creates a whole Linux distribution with separation of processes, files and network. * Containers are more lightweight than VMs since they don't virtualize hardware.",

For instance if the database container was compromised by unwelcome visitors, they would not have access to modify the web server configuration, and the container would not be able to expose additional services to the Internet. * A big advantage of containers is that there are large registries of community-provided container images. * Note that modifying things inside a container is harder than in a usual machine, as changes from the image are lost when a container is recreated.\n* Typically containers run just one tool or applications, and for service deployment this is useful for instance to run mySQL database in a separate container from a NodeJS application.",

More advanced container deployment solutions like {% tool \"kubernetes\" %} and Computational Workflow Management systems can also manage cloud instances and handle analytical usage. {% tool \"openstack\" %} is an open-source platform that uses pooled virtual resources to build and manage private and public clouds. It provides a stable base for deploying and managing containers, allowing for faster application deployment and simplified management. Tips and tricks to navigate the landscape of container solutions: If you just need to run a database server, describe how to run it as a Docker\/Singularity container.",

Description\nUsing containerization together with workflow management systems provides several benefits for data analysis, including:\n\nReproducibility: By using containerized environments and workflow management systems, you can ensure that your analysis is reproducible, as the environment in which the analysis is executed is exactly the same each time. Portability: Containerized environments can be easily moved between different computing environments, allowing you to execute your analysis on different computing resources or share your analysis with collaborators. Scalability: Workflow management systems can be used to execute analyses on large computing clusters (like the EuroHPC supercomputer {% tool \"lumi\" %}) or cloud computing resources, enabling you to scale your analysis as needed.

You can do this by running a test dataset through the workflow and checking the outputs to ensure they match the expected results. Once you have tested the workflow, the next step is to run it on your dataset. Depending on the size of your data, you can run the workflow locally on your computer or on a remote workflow management system. Solutions\n\nMost workflow management systems provide detailed tutorials and documentation for creating workflows and including containerization technologies. Here are documentations for Nextflow, Snakemake, Cromwell, CWL. The {% tool \"biocontainers\" %} project provides a platform for storing and sharing containers that can used in your workflow. The {% tool \"bio-tools\" %} repository lists state of the art tools and databases from the field of bioinformatics ordered by collections and communities.",

Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour. Use welcoming and inclusive language. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner.

Developed and managed by people who work every day with life science data, RDMkit has guidelines, information and pointers, organised in many different ways to help you with problems throughout the data’s life cycle. You will find helpful advice for where you are in the data’s life cycle (from collection planning to archiving) and for what kind of data problem you may have. Our up to date tools and resources lists are smartly cross-linked to these guidelines. We also have tailored help for different areas of biology and their specialist data types, and real examples of how tools have been assembled to support data management.
